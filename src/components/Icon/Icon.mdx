# Icon

Icons are free to use svg's from the [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons/v4) library.

They are converted into React components using [Chakra UI's Icon component](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/icon#using-the-icon-component).

<Canvas of={IconStories.Icon} sourceState={"none"} />
<Controls of={IconStories.Icon} />

## Usage

To import a specific Icon you can you the following syntax `import { IconName } from "./Icons"`.

<Source
  code={`
// Example using ChevronDown

import { ChevronDown } from "./Icons";
`}
/>

A list of all currently included icons with click to copy names can be found on the [icons page](?path=/story/icons--icons).
